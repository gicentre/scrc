#### QUESTIONS


--

Model quite like, but different to SNS

Parameters - we try to estimate these
State - what actually happens in the system
Posterior is probability of the data given the state

Markov Chain Monte-Carlo ... visualize these as estimates of parameters!

Complex models

-> SImple Models

Time 0.003 minutes - 0.18 seconds

Multisim
 - uncertainty, ensembles, natural variation

Inference
 - estimating model parameters from data

Prediction / counterfactual
 - based on posterior
 - counterfactual (what if we vary facts that go in! sensitvity?)
 -


> And we perform inference on it
> Can we recover the true R from the data?

WANT TO
 - estimate geographical varation in transmission
 - work out susceptibility?
 - work out effects of vaccination?


MINOR THINGS!
 - characteristics of inference algorithms (novelty)


---

EXPLORE -
specific views

DESIGN
DEAD is small

--

Exploring the posterior
Conterfactuals  - explore the vaccination (concrete problem, built on inference runs).
How do design good vaccination strategies.
