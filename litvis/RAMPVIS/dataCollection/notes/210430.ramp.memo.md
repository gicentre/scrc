### VDL, RAMPVIS, Memos & Structured Reporting

#### Introduction

##### JD says ...

1. Reflective memos
 * systematic in promoting reflection-in-action
 * what to record so that we have a useful and compatible record

2. I have a simple _SCHEMA_

3. Can you do a _TALK_ for RAMPVIS group?

##### JR says ...
 - keen to input on reflexivity through the design process,

 ##### Arrange MEETING

 - _chat initially in a small group to establish context and try to get a sense of what might work._

#### Rogers et al : Experiments With Rigor in EvoBio

> We recommend that design study researchers plan for a trrrace early in a study and consider [these] important issues

 1. the process of collecting artifacts greatly benefits from establishing a system for organization early on
 2. develop mechanisms to automatically extract concept tags from the artifacts themselves
 3. develop a system for anonymising artifacts
 4. be open about recordings - establish what will be on- versus off-record

> reflection

 * design study researchers plan for the time and space to engage critically and reflectively with their research artifacts and experiences
 * look for things that changed, shifted, and surprised.

 > _establish systematic reflective practices from the outset - these should include reflexive notes, reflective transcriptions, and artifact curation_

#### Things we MAY want to look for (Top Down)

Some early thinking (_this is a non-exhaustive list of ideas generated during the EuroVIS paper writing_) about this suggests that we may have something to say on :

 - use of, or opportunities for, _visualization in epidemiological modeling_ - **#epiVIS**
 - aspects of _design by immersion_ (see Hall et al., 2020) in lockdown (or the online workplace/workspace) - **#immersion**
 - visualization _design in a pandemic_ - **#panDesign**
 - specific approaches to _COVID vis design_ **#covidVIS**

Wants _core subset of categories to start playing_.
