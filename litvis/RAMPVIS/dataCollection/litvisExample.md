**Jason** says ...
_interesting to see similar looking maps in different places in an OD map - this is pretty rare - we are usually looking for autocorrelation. But the islands, West and North have similar levels of similarity and so the maps repeat. I guess that here we see trends that are (presumably) to do with 'type of place' rather than location._
