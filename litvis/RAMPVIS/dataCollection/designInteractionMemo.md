## Fake Meeting with Nobody - 21/03/05

This document structure and [YAML schema](../narrative-schemas/designMemo.yml) are intended to support _Reflection In Action_ when engaging with **RAMPVIS** modellers and _Reflection On Action_ subsequently.

Write in here using standard **MarkDown** and agreed tags and structure in line with [YAML schema](../narrative-schemas/designInteractionMemo.yml).

Use of the [litvis](https://www.gicentre.net/litvis) environment is supported but not required.

A direction ... we can have many of these!

{|direction)}

Add _text_, _imagery_, _demos_  and discussion _in markup_ in between tagged notes.

{(reaction|}

A reaction ... we can have many of these!

E.g. [Spatial Model Progress Update](https://github.com/aidans/ramp/blob/main/notes/README.md)

 * **Aidan:** could try and calibrate the models on the data between old/new variants and the different types of lockdown.

 * **Claire:** check spatial references in model files

{(traction|}

A traction ... we can have many of these!

{|traction)}

We need some structure at the end of the document too ...


{(memoEnd|}
 * We _REQUIRE one_ of these to promote _Reflection on Action_.
 * We _ALLOW many_ of these to promote _ongoing_ _Reflection on Action_.
